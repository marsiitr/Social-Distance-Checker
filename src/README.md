  <h1>How to download Open-cv</h1>
  <p>
  
  * First we need to download Pycharm with the steps shown in the given link
  </p>
  
[Steps to download](https://youtu.be/MoeQlmeJnPg)

* After downloading Pycharm we have to download several packages from the "python packages" tab present at the bottom of Pycharm IDE screen.
* Now type the following packages on the search bar : 

          opencv-python
          numpy
          Tensorflow
          Keras
          Matplotlib
          Scipy 
* After downloading all these packages we are ready to go.. lets see how to code

  We have done this project in two phases :
       
  * Social distancing detection(sdd)
         
  * Mask detection
  
  and then we have integrated both the parts. Lets see how to do social distancing detection part.

  <h2>Brief explanation of our sdd code</h2>
  <p>
  First we have to import necessary packages by using "import" funtion.

  After importing packages shown in above image we have downloaded several model files(model files are pre trained files for example, we have a file named centroidtracker which is used to pairup different objects which we can use directly in the code to make the code shorter).We can download these files from the src folder.
